      highest standards of security,
      both for our cutting-edge technology and for our valuable user data.

      Having served in key roles within the Indian Army, I developed expertise in managing large teams, complex operations,
      and high-stakes environments. My transition into the world of STEM education, entrepreneurship, and strategic advisory
      allowed me to apply my military leadership experience in education technology and innovation — particularly in personalized
      learning and human performance optimization. This unique blend of military discipline and technological insight makes me
      uniquely suited to lead <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span> through its growth and operational challenges.

      Some of my important achievements have been the investigative analysis on internal and external ballistics of Tank
      T-72 and T-90 and the occurrence of accidents. I led Ministry of Defence investigative teams to Russia and other countries,
      consisting of scientists and officers from the ARMY, DRDO, DGQA, CPE, PXE, OFB, and DMRL, on scientific fact-finding missions to
      enhance weapon reliability and transfer of Technology I have been instrumental in designing the digital control harnesses
