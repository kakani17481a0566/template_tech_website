    <h3>A Distinguished Leader with 33 Years of Military Experience and 5 Years in STEM Education & Entrepreneurship</h3>
    <p>
      As the Chief Business Officer (CBO) and Chief Security Officer (CSO) of <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi<sup class="tm-badge">™</sup></span>, I bring a wealth of 
      experience that spans over 33 years in the Indian Army, as well as 5 years in the fields of STEM education, 
      entrepreneurship, and strategic advisory roles. My career journey has been marked by a deep commitment to discipline, 
      strategic decision-making, leadership, and innovation. With <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi<sup class="tm-badge">™</sup></span>, my focus is to drive business growth and ensure the 
      highest standards of security, 
      both for our cutting-edge technology and for our valuable user data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having served in key roles within the Indian Army, I developed expertise in managing large teams, complex operations,
       and high-stakes environments. My transition into the world of STEM education, entrepreneurship, and strategic advisory 
       allowed me to apply my military leadership experience in education technology and innovation—particularly in personalized 
       learning and human performance optimization. This unique blend of military discipline and technological insight makes me
       uniquely suited to lead <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi<sup class="tm-badge">™</sup></span> through its growth and operational challenges.
    </p>


    <h3>Key Experience and Expertise</h3>
    <p>
     Military Leadership & Operations (33 Years): Extensive leadership experience in the Indian Army,
      where I honed skills in strategic planning, high-pressure decision-making, and leading diverse teams
       to achieve critical missions. I played an integral role in national security, operational coordination, 
       and leadership development, shaping my approach to both business strategy and human performance optimization. 
       Some of my important achievements have been the Investigative analysis on internal and external ballistics of Tank 
       T 72 and T 90 and occurrence of accidents. I led Ministry of Defence investigative teams to Russia and other countries 
       consisting of scientists and Officers from the ARMY, DRDO, DGQA, CPE, PXE, OFB, DMRL on scientific fact finding to 
       enhance weapon reliability and transfer of technology. I have been instrumental in designing the digital control harnesses 
       for Tank T 72 and Tank 90 which are presently in use in all ground-based Fighting vehicles of the Armed Forces.
    </p>
    <h3>Education & Advisory (5 Years)</h3>
    <p>
     Following my military service, I transitioned to STEM education, where I advised on curriculum development 
     and the integration of cutting-edge technologies for personalized learning.  I have been a Director and Professor 
     in Defence Institute of Armament and Technology, Pune University (MILIT). I am the state convener for overseeing AICTE 
     initiatives in Telangana Colleges in India. I am also a Defence Consultant with the DRDO and Army and a Consultant 
     (subject matter expert for arms and ammunition manufacture) with the best Public Sector Undertaking Company in India (a MAHARATNA).
    </p>
    <h3>Entrepreneurship & Business Development</h3>
    <p>
     As an entrepreneur, I’ve founded and scaled multiple ventures at the intersection of education, technology, 
     and human performance, driving business strategy, growth, and operational execution.  I  am a Director in two 
     successful companies in Hyderabad. My focus is on ensuring that <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi<sup class="tm-badge">™</sup></span> continues to expand its impact on a global scale, 
     with strategic growth in healthcare, education, and performance sectors.
