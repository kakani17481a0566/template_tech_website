    <h2>Dr. Aperna Volluru</h2>
    <p class="designation">Founder & Managing Director</p>

    <h3>About My School ITALY</h3>
    <p>
      My School ITALY was born from the Founder’s passion for children and from her thought of developing the pedagogical project starting from the real needs of the child and parents.
      Being an IT Professional, a Linguist, a Child Psychologist, Neuroscientist, and Mother, she started her entrepreneurial journey by opening an Online School for sick children in 2002 in Italy.
      To reach out to the children in the Indian Sub-Continent, she started with the Preschool chain.
    </p>

    <h3>Early Life & Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      The Founder was born in India, and she spent the first few years of her life there, before moving to Europe.
      The memory of a childhood spent in large, bright spaces led her to create a place where children can grow daily surrounded by a mutual connection between education and the beauty of architecture—
      a place where the attention they receive can be a stimulus to understand and interpret the world that surrounds them.
    </p>

    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    <p>
      Her three decades of professional experience in IT, Neuroscience, and early childhood services helped her to design a child-centric environment with special spaces rich in affection, care, safety, and stimulation—
      innovative games and unusual scenarios that constantly remind the adults of the attention that must be given to small things to help children grow slowly but in a solid way…
    </p>

    <h3>Awards & Recognition</h3>
    <p>The Founder has to her laurels some of the most prestigious Awards like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>UK Queen’s Award</li>
      <li>European Union’s JRC Award</li>
      <li>Sweden’s Open Knowledge Award</li>
      <li>European Union’s Business Award 2019</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As Albert Einstein said, “The only source of knowledge is the experience”, the Co-Founder’s experience has made My School ITALY a safe haven and a second home for children.
      This Arcadia can be trusted by any parent who is concerned about her/his child’s learning, care, and growth.
