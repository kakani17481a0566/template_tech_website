    <h4 style="font-style: italic;">Blending Science, Compassion, and Innovation to Unlock Human Potential.</h4>
    <p>
      As the Founder and CEO of <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span>, and a trailblazer with over 30+ years of experience across technology,
      neuroscience, child psychology, education, entrepreneurship and philanthropy, my journey has been guided by a deep
      and enduring curiosity: How can we better understand human potential — and help each person truly thrive?<br />
      &nbsp;<span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span> was born from that question. It brings together decades of learning, research, and real-world
      application to build a platform that respects each individual’s uniqueness, while offering cutting-edge tools to help them
      grow — intellectually, emotionally, and professionally.
      <br />My career has never followed a straight line — and that’s intentional. I’ve worked at the crossroads of
      scientific discovery, technological innovation, and human development, always with a belief that no single discipline holds
      all the answers. From leading data-driven research at the European Union’s Joint Research Centre, to developing
      learning frameworks for children and adults, to building businesses that serve real human needs — every step has
      been about bridging knowledge with compassion.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Bring to <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Technology & Data Science:</strong> 15+ years of leadership in tech innovation, particularly in AI, data
      science, and building scalable platforms that serve people.
      <br /><strong>Neuroscience & Psychology:</strong> A deep understanding of how the brain learns and grows,
      especially in childhood — and how we can nurture that growth in meaningful ways.
      <br /><strong>Education & Learning Design:</strong> Experience creating personalized cognitive learning strategies
      that respect each learner’s pace, style, and strengths.
      <br /><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> A hands-on approach to building diverse ventures — from education and
      early learning to design, film, and hospitality — always with a human-centered focus.
    </p>

    <h3>Recognition & Values</h3>
    <p>
      Along the way, I’ve been humbled to receive recognition from organizations that value both innovation and impact, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>UK Queen’s Award (Education)</li>
      <li>JRC Award (Technology, EU)</li>
      <li>Sweden’s Open Knowledge Award (Business Initiative)</li>
      <li>European Business Award (Entrepreneurship)</li>
      <li>Guinness World Record (Philanthropy & Community Impact)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But more important than awards are the people we serve — the learners, parents, athletes, educators, and professionals who trust NeuroPi to support their journeys.
    </p>

    <h3>Why <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span> Exists</h3>

      but by understanding themselves more deeply. Our platform uses AI, genetics, and neuroscience to deliver
