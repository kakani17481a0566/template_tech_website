        <h3>Strategic Financial Leadership & Governance</h3>
        <p>
            The Chief Financial Officer of <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span> is a Chartered Accountant with deep
            experience in institutional finance, capital structuring, and governance for high-growth technology and
            healthcare platforms. He brings a rare combination of Big Four training and hands-on operator exposure,
            positioning him as a capital steward across fundraising, scale, and eventual exit cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
            He began his career at KPMG, where he worked on statutory audits, IPO-linked assignments, and financial
            reporting for listed and multinational groups, including environments governed by SOX and US GAAP–linked
            reporting. This foundation has shaped a rigorous approach to financial controls, investor-grade reporting,
            and board-level transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond assurance, he has led funding readiness and capital strategy for promoter-led and institutionally
            backed businesses, advising on valuation frameworks, cap-table architecture, ESOP design, dilution
            management, and working-capital optimization. He has worked closely with Founder and Senior Management on
            cash runway planning, burn discipline, and unit-economics tracking, ensuring growth is pursued with capital
            efficiency and downside protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            At <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span>, he owns the end-to-end finance mandate — including capital
            allocation, fundraising support, investor communications, governance, and exit preparedness. He acts as a
            strategic partner to the founder and Board, ensuring that <span class="neuro-title">NeuroPi</span> scales
            with financial discipline, defensible valuations, and institutional credibility, while protecting long-term
            equity value for shareholders.
