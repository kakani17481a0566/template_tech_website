    <p>
      Since the beginning of my professional career, I have always taken an unconventional approach and thought in
      terms of a sustainable vision. My multi-talented career started with a Big Four accounting firm where I
      accompanied M&A transactions as a management consultant before joining top-tier US law firms advising on
      private equity and venture capital transactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have further served (and still serve) on various boards of DACH-based multi-family offices, managing and
      overseeing venture capital as well as private equity investments and scaling startups. Today, I invest,
      alongside the biggest names in US Tech, in several technology and ESG-focused ventures that drive foremost
      social but also environmental impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      I strongly believe that businesses can create value and change the world simultaneously. As a lifelong learner,
      I trust in education as the foundation of society and the path to sustainable development calling it
      <strong>"LONGCIETY"</strong>.
